# CatHeadWebApp
<b>CatHead, A Fun, Free, Facile, Feline, JavaScript Web App Game</b>

<b>NERD ALERT:</b> CatHead is a graphicly-rich browser based game that combines the rendering power of WebGL using THREE.js, and the cross-platform functionality of ES6 and JavaScript.

<b>OBJECTIVE:</b> Use the Joystick (or Keyboard) to maneuver CatHead through the twisting labyrinth and find the exit (catbox) before time runs out (envision an urgent, desperate race to find a bathroom, then add danger).

<b>OBSTACLES:</b> Beware the DogHead, a beast most heinous and foul (Pomeranian) for he too wanders the maze, tirelessly searching for his sworn enemy (yes, you).

<b>SURVIVE:</b> Even a brief brush with DogHead can gravely wound CatHead, the only known remedy is the legendary healing properties imparted by the wing dust of the rare and reclusive giant MazeMoth (wing dust is administered topically, no moths are harmed in its procurement and manufacture).

<b>PLAY:</b>  For the best possible experience (don't play game) adventurous early-adopters can find the most up-to-date playable version at:

For those who find the game so compelling (mom) that it must be available even when internet is not, an Android App can be downloaded from the Play Store at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vwgreen.cathead&hl=en_US.

<b>JOIN:</b> The underlying purpose behind CatHead is twofold, to explore the future of SaaS WebApps wand add value to the coding community, and to create a mechanism to (hopefully) help fund the ongoiong philanthropic efforts of local non-profit Animal Shelters.  To summarize, we love coding and cats (and dogs, plus moths are kinda neat also) and we sincerely hope that anyone that happens upon this game will subsequently take up the torch by offering to contribute to this fun and meaningful project.
